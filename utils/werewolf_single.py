"""Single-player Werewolf engine (simplified)
------------------------------------------------
This is an intentionally **much smaller** re-implementation of Werewolf that can
be played solo against AI opponents.  It is *not* a drop-in replacement for the
full multi-player engine in `utils.werewolf`, but it re-uses its `Role` and
`Side` enums so that wording and translations stay consistent.

For v1 we purposefully keep the role set small (Werewolf, Seer, Villager) to
avoid an explosion of AI logic.  This can be extended later.
