# This is an implementation of Werewolf: The Pact
# The Pact includes the extensions:
# - New Moon
# - The Community
# - Characters
# I have left out the raven and the pyro from "The Community"
# the house part is not my favourite
# The "New Moon" cards are also not included, hence
# the shake and the gypsy are not here
# "Werewolf" is a game by Philippe des Pallières and Hervé Marly
# Thank you for making such an awesome game!
