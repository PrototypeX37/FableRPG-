            Your partner and you can enter a name for your child once the bot prompts you to. (Do not include `{prefix}`)
            If you fail to choose a name in time, the bot will choose one for you from about 500 pre-picked ones.

            For identification purposes, you cannot have two children with the same name in your family, so make sure to pick a unique one.
