            Runs a game of The Vault for your players. Free to enter, with a
            prize pool you put up for the occasion. Built for admin-run events.

            The vault holds a hidden amount that nobody is told. Each round it is
            drilled and the take is split between everyone still inside, adding to
            a haul that is not yet safe. Players then privately choose to **stay
            in** for another round or **walk away** and bank what they hold. If a
            drill hits an empty vault, everyone still inside loses their entire
            haul. Players are told how full the vault looks, never how much is left.

            The pool is not typed into the channel. Once the lobby opens, press
            **Set Prize Pool** and enter the amount privately, so players never
            learn how deep the vault runs. You can change it any time before the
            lobby closes.

            Usage:
            `{prefix}gmvault`
            `{prefix}gmvault theme=casino timer=20 min=5`

            Options:
            - `timer` (10-120) - seconds players get to decide each round
            - `join` (30-600) - lobby countdown in seconds
            - `min` / `max` - player limits
            - `solo` (0-40) - % bonus for being the only one to walk in a round
            - `drillmin` / `drillmax` - size of each drill, as a % of the vault
            - `surge` (0-60) - % of drills that hit several times harder
            - `surgesize` (100-500) - how much bigger a surge is, as a %
            - `floor` (20-100) - smallest the hidden vault can roll, as a % of the pool
            - `theme` - heist, corporate, casino or pirate

            Notes:
            - Game Masters only, because the prize is generated rather than paid in.
            - You do not play, since you know how much is in there.
            - Nobody pays to join, and players need a character to be paid.
            - A rules card is posted above the lobby for first-time players.
            - The lobby shows only whether a pool has been set, never the amount.
            - If the lobby closes without a pool set, the game is called off.
            - The pool is the hard ceiling on payouts: the hidden vault rolls
              between the `floor` percentage of it and the whole amount."""
